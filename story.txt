In the year 2019, a student of the perfect Deb named Alex was dreading the next morning.
It was the fifth week of his favorite professors class and his next project was due in two hours.
He had nothing done and had no idea what to do.
tempted by sloth, he went to GitHub.
Alex's stress levels were very high. The project required working with his team who were still in the storming stage. Their team wasn't on the performing level like xteam18. Oh how he wished he could be in xteam18

Alex scoured GitHub for anything that resembled his project. As he searched GitHub, time kept on marching on and the due date got closer and closer. With 15 minutes left he found a perfect replica of the project he was looking for. Lucky find.
"This sounds like a project for Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V" Alex remarked. He copied the code exactly into eclipse and was greeted by dozens of errors. Oh no!
